## Project Description
This project demonstrates advanced data structure implementation through three multiplayer turn-based games. Developed as part of our Data Structures course under the supervision of **Eng. Moutair**, it showcases:
- Queue-based turn management
- Complex move validation algorithms
- State preservation for undo/redo functionality
- Graphical user interface with Pygame

Key components include:
- Game state management
- Rule enforcement engines
- Interactive GUI
- Win condition detection

## Features
- **Common Framework** for all three games
- **Turn Management** using queues
- **Undo/Redo** functionality with stack
- **Interactive GUI** with Pygame
- **Special Game Rules** implemented (snakes/ladders, chess moves, ludo captures)
- **Multiplayer Support** (2-4 players depending on game)

## Games Overview

### Snake & Ladder
Classic dice-based race to the top with:
- Random dice rolls
- Snake and ladder jumps
- 2-player turn system

## Data Structures Used
| Data Structure       | Usage in Project                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Queue                | Player turn management                   |
| Stack                | Undo/redo functionality                  |
| 2D Arrays            | Board representations                   |
| Dictionaries         | Snake/ladder mappings, piece positions  |
| Graphs               | Chess move validation                   |
| Object-Oriented      | Game pieces and player management       |

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiplayer-game-engine.git
     ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame numpy
    ```
3. Run the desired game:
    ```bash
    python snake_ladder.py
    python chess.py
    python ludo.py
    ```

## How to Play
- Snake & Ladder: Press spacebar to roll dice
- Chess: Click to select pieces and destinations
- Ludo: Click dice to roll, then click your token
